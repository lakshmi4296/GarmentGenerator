# **SECTION 2 : EXECUTIVE SUMMARY / PAPER ABSTRACT**

In today’s competitive fashion industry, designers are looking for newer and better ways for designing apparel and launching them into the market. 

Designing new garments as per the preferences of the designer can pose a big challenge as the designer may run of out of new ideas for ready to market garment designs.  

Due to rapid pace of change in fashion trends, automated generation of apparel design has become popular. 

Using the generative adversarial network, we train the model with large garment dataset with which we expect to receive new garment designs.
